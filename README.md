# Web scraping

This project is a basic web scraping setup that allows users to retrieve and analyze data from a specified URL. 

# Before scraping
Please verify that the target URL is accessible and returns a 200 (OK) response.

1.Define the URL you want to scrape: 

```
  url = "https://example.com"
```

2.Check if the URL is accessible:

```
  import requests
  url_request = requests.get(url)
  print(url_request.status_code)
```
Ensure that the response status code is 200, indicating that the URL is accessible and ready for scraping.

3.Examine the HTML structure of the target page:

* Open the page in your web browser.
* Right-click on the page and select Inspect (or Inspect Element).
* This will open the Developer Tools pane, allowing you to explore the page's HTML structure.
* Review the HTML elements and decide which parts of the page you want to scrape (e.g., specific tags, classes, or IDs).

4 Identify elements to scrape:

* Based on the HTML structure, determine the tags or attributes (such as div, span, class, id, etc.) containing the data you need.
* Make note of these elements to use in your web scraping code

**Note: Inspecting the HTML structure of the target page beforehand is crucial for effective web scraping, as it helps identify the precise elements you want to retrieve.**
